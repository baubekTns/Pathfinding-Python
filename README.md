# Pathfinding-Python

This project visualizes the A\* pathfinding algorithm in a grid with randomly generated obstacles. The start and end points are also randomly placed, and the algorithm searches for the shortest path from the start to the end, considering 8 possible movement directions (including diagonals).

## Features

- **Random Maze Generation**: The maze is generated with obstacles, and both the start and end positions are randomly placed.
- **A\* Pathfinding Algorithm**: Implements the A\* algorithm to find the shortest path from the start to the end, considering diagonal movement.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

To install Pygame, run:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
